### Network:
  + If you have an issue that your DSM is not shown in Network: Switch LKM "prod" or "dev" both can work, depends on Hardware.
  + If you donâ€™t get an ip while boot, shut down and power on device (do not restart and check that fastboot/silentboot is disabled)

### HP Systems:
  + If you have an issue that your DSM is not booting correctly: Set Directboot to "true". (Some HP Device will only work with Directboot.)
